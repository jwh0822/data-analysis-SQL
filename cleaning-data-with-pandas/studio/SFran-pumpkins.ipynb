    "# Data Cleaning Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "You are part of a team working for an agricultural nonprofit based in California. Your nonprofit focuses on helping farmers in the state grow profitable crops in environmentally-friendly ways in an effort to reduce the impact of climate change on the state and provide enough food for the state's 39.5 million residents. With Halloween on the horizon, you and your team are looking to analyze past pumpkin crops to try and answer several questions:\n",
    "1. Are pumpkins sold at terminal markets in California (San Francisco and Los Angeles) grown in California?\n",
    "1. Is the harvest season for pumpkins grown in California consistent year-to-year?\n",
    "1. Are pumpkin farmers growing specific varieties of pumpkins for specific reasons?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to these questions will help your nonprofit decide if they should promote specific varieties or growing practices to the farmers they serve in time for seeds to be planted next year. Your team has already performed some exploratory analysis on the San Francisco terminal market report of pumpkin sales from 9/2016-9/2017. Now it is time to clean the data!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in to cleaning the data, here is a quick guide to the different columns in the USDA report and what they mean:\n",
    "- Commodity Name: This CSV structure is used for lots of USDA reports. In this case, the commodity is pumpkins\n",
    "- City Name: City where the pumpkin was sold. The city is a terminal market location within the United States.\n",
    "- Type: This refers to the type of farming used in growing the pumpkins\n",
    "- Package: The way the pumpkins were packed for sale\n",
    "- Variety: Specific type of pumpkin, i.e. pie pumpkin or a Howden pumpkin\n",
    "- Sub Variety: Addition classifications about the pumpkins, i.e. is it a flat pumpkin?\n",
    "- Grade: In the US, usually only canned pumpkin is graded\n",
    "- Date: Date of sale (rounded up to the nearest Saturday)\n",
    "- Low Price: This price is in reference to sale price\n",
    "- High Price: This price is in reference to sale price\n",
    "- Mostly Low: This column is not measured for pumpkins\n",
    "- Mostly High: This column is not measured for pumpkins\n",
    "- Origin: Which state the pumpkins were grown in\n",
    "- Origin District: Additional information about pumpkins' origin location\n",
    "- Item Size: Abbreviations denoting size, i.e. jbo = jumbo, lrg = large\n",
    "- Color: Color of pumpkins\n",
    "- Environment: Additional information about pumpkins' growing environment\n",
    "- Unit of Sale: The unit the customer bought at market, i.e. if they bought pumpkins by the pound, the data should say \"PER LB\" or  if they bought pumpkins by the bin, it would say \"PER BIN\"\n",
    "- Quality: Additional notes about pumpkin quality as necessary\n",
    "- Condition: Additional notes about pumpkin condition as necessary\n",
    "- Appearance: Additional notes about pumpkin appearance as necessary\n",
    "- Storage: Additional notes about pumpkin storage as necessary\n",
    "- Crop: Additional notes about pumpkin crop as necessary\n",
    "- Repack: Whether the pumpkin has been repackaged before sale\n",
    "- Trans Mode: Mode of transportation used to get pumpkins to terminal market"
